		<name>NMap</name>
		<tooltiptext>NMap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques (determine what services the hosts are offering), version detection (determine what application/service is runing on a port), and TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). It also offers flexible target and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning, SunRPC scanning, and more. Most Unix and Windows platforms are supported in both GUI and command line modes. Several popular handheld devices are also supported, including the Sharp Zaurus and the iPAQ.</tooltiptext>

                    <description>This is the most basic form of TCP scanning.  The connect() system call provided by your operating  system  is used  to  open  a  connection  to  every interesting port on the machine. If the port is listening, connect() will succeed,  oth- erwise  the  port  isn't reachable. One strong advantage to this technique is that you don't need  any  special  privileges.  Anyuser on most UNIX boxes is free to use this call.</description>

                    <description> Ping scanning: Sometimes you only want to know which hosts on  a network  are  up.  Nmap can do this by sending ICMP echo request packets to every IP address on the networks you specify.   Hosts that   respond  are  up.   Unfortunately,  some  sites  such  as microsoft.com block echo request packets.  Thus  nmap  can  also send a TCP ack packet to (by default) port 80.  If we get an RST back, that machine is up.  A third technique involves sending  a SYN  packet  and  waiting  for a RST or a SYN/ACK.  For non-root users, a connect() method is used.</description>

                    <description>This method is used to determine which UDP (User Datagram Protocol, RFC 768) ports are open on a host.  The tech- nique  is  to send 0 byte UDP packets to each port on the target machine.  If we receive an ICMP port unreachable  message,  then the  port  is closed.  Otherwise we assume it is open.  Unfortunately, firewalls often block  the  port  unreachable  messages, causing  the  port  to appear open.  Sometimes an ISP will block only a few specific dangerous ports such as 31337 (back orifice) and  139 (Windows NetBIOS), making it look like these vulnerable ports are open.  So don't panic immediately.  Unfortunately,  it isn't  always  trivial  to  differentiate  between real open UDP ports and these filtered false-positives.</description>

                    <description>This allows the scanning of networks that don't allow ICMP  echo requests  (or  responses) through their firewall.  microsoft.com is an example of such a network, and thus you should always  use -P0  or  -PT80 when portscanning microsoft.com.  Note tht "ping" in this contect may involve more than the traditional ICMP  echo request packet.  Nmap supports many such probes, including arbi- trary combinations of TCP, UDP, and ICMP  probes.   By  default, Nmap sends an ICMP echo request and a TCP ACK packet to port 80.</description>
