If you work on this package just comment on every thing you change. 


Gui is almost done.

The Gui works just the interface tabs have to be pointed to the right files.

snort.inc 
Must be recoded so that it reads the [snortglobal][rule] options in conf.xml and makes a snort.sh, snort.conf, and barnyard.conf.
This is easy, just cut and paste from the old snort.inc.

snort_rules_edit.php 
Is what Im working on. Just make sure all snort sig options are supported.

snort_rules.php 
Change the way the rules get disabled, by removing the x icon image and replacing it with check boxes.
This should improve the users use of the package.

Done.
