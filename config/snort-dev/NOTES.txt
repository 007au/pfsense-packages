If you work on this package just comment on every-thing you change or add. 


Gui is almost done.

snort.inc 
Must be recoded so that it reads the [snortglobal][rule] options in conf.xml and makes a snort.sh, snort.conf, and barnyard.conf.
This is easy, just cut and paste from the old snort.inc.

snort_rules_edit.php 
What I am working on. Just make sure all snort sig options are supported.

snort_rules.php 
Change the way the rules get disabled, by removing the x icon image and replacing it with check boxes.
This should improve the users use of the package. Moreover, check boxes could be added to blocked.php tab to improve performance.
Users always complain that the way were deleting options is slow. 

create whitelist.php and help_info.php

Done.
