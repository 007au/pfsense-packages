Snort_inline due date is by Dec 1st. (Why ? Scott said so.)

Gui is almost done. just odds and ends left.

If you work on this package just comment on every-thing you change or add. 

====================
Goals
====================

Release the New snort GUI as a package for 1.2.3 so that we can work out bugs.

Move the Snort GUI to base of Pfsense. The divert options should be added to firewall_nat.php or firewall_rules.php.

Ask Ermal to add divert out to Pfsense again though, he has kept divert in.

=================================
Any Devs that would like to help please work on snort_rules_edit.php and snort_rules.php. They work but need cleaning up.
=================================

To get snort_rules_edit.php and snort_rules.php working 

Add at least on rule to snort_interfaces.php.

Add at least one snort rule file to /usr/local/etc/snort/snort_0vr1/rules/.
Should look like this /usr/local/etc/snort/snort_0vr1/rules/attack-responses.rules.
Note that "snort_0vr1" should be chaned to what interface option you added.

snort_rules_edit.php 
Make sure all snort sig options that are in the GUI are written to file.

snort_rules.php 
Change the way the rules get disabled, by removing the x icon image and replacing it with check boxes.
This should improve the users experience. Moreover, check boxes could be added to blocked.php tab to improve performance.
Users always complain that the way were deleting options is slow. 

create whitelist.php and help_info.php


===========================================
Misc.
===========================================

Adding extry options to the new snort gui for snort_inline should be easy once we have it working.

Snort_inline binaries with custom c++ code ready to go.

Snort_inline works with only one Wan and Lan. Add a Opt onterface and the TCP flow goes into a loop.
This should be easy to fix by the firewall guru by modifying the divert rule I am using.
 

 
Done.
